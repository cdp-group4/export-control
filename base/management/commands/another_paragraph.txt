                            biological) in training, research, testing or evaluation.
                     3.    For the purposes of 1A004, 'radioactive materials' are those selected or modified to
                            increase their effectiveness in producing casualties in humans or animals, degrading

CATEGORY 1 – SPECIAL MATERIALS AND RELATED EQUIPMENT

1A007   Equipment and devices, specially designed to initiate charges and devices containing "energetic
       materials", by electrical means, as follows:
       N.B.   SEE ALSO MILITARY GOODS CONTROLS, 3A229 AND 3A232.
       a.     Explosive detonator firing sets designed to drive explosive detonators specified in 1A007.b.;
       b.     Electrically driven explosive detonators as follows:
              1.     Exploding bridge (EB);
              2.     Exploding bridge wire (EBW);
              3.     Slapper;
              4.     Exploding foil initiators (EFI).
       Technical Notes:
              1.    The word initiator or igniter is sometimes used in place of the word detonator.
              2.    For the purpose of 1A007.b. the detonators of concern all utilise a small electrical conductor
                     (bridge, bridge wire, or foil) that explosively vaporises when a fast, high-current electrical pulse
                     is passed through it. In non-slapper types, the exploding conductor starts a chemical detonation
                     in a contacting high explosive material such as PETN (pentaerythritoltetranitrate). In slapper
                     detonators, the explosive vaporization of the electrical conductor drives a flyer or slapper across
                     a gap, and the impact of the slapper on an explosive starts a chemical detonation. The slapper
                     in some designs is driven by magnetic force. The term exploding foil detonator may refer to
                     either an EB or a slapper-type detonator.
1A008   Charges, devices and components, as follows:
       a.     'Shaped charges' having all of the following:

              2.     A width of 10 mm or more;
       c.     Detonating cord with explosive core load greater than 64 g/m;
