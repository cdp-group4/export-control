        Note 1:       1A005 does not control body armour when accompanying its user for the user's own
                      personal protection.

                      both fragment and blast from non-military explosive devices.
        Note 3:       1A005 does not control body armour designed to provide protection only from knife,

        CATEGORY 1 – SPECIAL MATERIALS AND RELATED EQUIPMENT

1A007   Equipment and devices, specially designed to initiate charges and devices containing "energetic
        materials", by electrical means, as follows:
        N.B.   SEE ALSO MILITARY GOODS CONTROLS, 3A229 AND 3A232.
        a.     Explosive detonator firing sets designed to drive explosive detonators specified in 1A007.b.;
        b.     Electrically driven explosive detonators as follows:
               1.     Exploding bridge (EB);
               2.     Exploding bridge wire (EBW);

               4.     Exploding foil initiators (EFI).
        Technical Notes:
        1.    The word initiator or igniter is sometimes used in place of the word detonator.
        2.    For the purpose of 1A007.b. the detonators of concern all utilise a small electrical conductor
              (bridge, bridge wire, or foil) that explosively vaporises when a fast, high-current electrical pulse
              is passed through it. In non-slapper types, the exploding conductor starts a chemical detonation
              in a contacting high explosive material such as PETN (pentaerythritoltetranitrate). In slapper
              detonators, the explosive vaporization of the electrical conductor drives a flyer or slapper across
              a gap, and the impact of the slapper on an explosive starts a chemical detonation. The slapper
              in some designs is driven by magnetic force. The term exploding foil detonator may refer to
              either an EB or a slapper-type detonator.

               to facilitate isolation, purification, amplification, detection, or identification of nucleic acids.
        3.     'Endow or enhance pathogenicity' is defined as when the insertion or integration of the nucleic
               acid sequence or sequences is/are likely to enable or increase a recipient organism’sability to
