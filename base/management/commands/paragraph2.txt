         materials", and specially designed or prepared equipment and components therefor, as follows:
         a.    Plant specially designed for separating isotopes of "natural uranium", "depleted uranium", or
         b.    Gas centrifuges and assemblies and components, specially designed or prepared for gas
               centrifuge separation process, as follows:
               1.    Gas centrifuges;
      2.   Centrifuge housing/recipients to contain the rotor tube assembly of a gas centrifuge,
            consisting of a rigid cylinder of wall thickness up to 30 mm with precision machined ends
            that are parallel to each other and perpendicular to the cylinder’s longitudinal axis to
            within 0,05  or less;
      3.   Scoops consisting of specially designed or prepared tubes for the extraction of UF6 gas
            from within the rotor tube by a Pitot tube action and capable of being fixed to the central
            gas extraction system;
