Graphite having a purity level better than 5 parts per million 'boron equivalent' and with a density greater
         than 1,50 g/cm3 for use in a "nuclear reactor", in quantities exceeding 1 kg.

         Note 1:       For the purpose of export control, the competent authorities of the EU Member State in
                       which the exporter is established will determine whether or not the exports of graphite
                       meeting the above specifications are for "nuclear reactor" use. 0C004 does not control
                       graphite having a purity level better than 5 ppm (parts per million) boron equivalent and
                       with a density greater than 1,50 g/cm3 not for use in a "nuclear reactor".
         Note 2:       In 0C004, 'boron equivalent' (BE) is defined as the sum of BE z for impurities (excluding
                       BEcarbon since carbon is not considered an impurity) including boron, where:
                       BEZ (ppm) = CF x concentration of element Z in ppm;

                         where CF is the conversion factor                                 =            ---------

                       and B and Z are the thermal neutron capture cross sections (in barns) for naturally
                       occurring boron and element Z respectively; and AB and AZ are the atomic masses of
                       naturally occurring boron and element Z respectively.
